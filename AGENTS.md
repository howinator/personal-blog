# AGENTS.md - Personal Blog (howinator.io)

## Overview

Hugo static site blog deployed to https://howinator.io/. Theme is `hugo-sustain` (git submodule).

## Key Files

- `config.toml` — Hugo site configuration (title, menus, social links, permalink structure)
- `archetypes/default.md` — Template used by `hugo new` to scaffold new posts
- `content/blog/` — All blog posts (flat directory, no date-based subdirectories)
- `themes/hugo-sustain/` — Active theme (git submodule, fork at howinator/hugo-sustain)
- `static/` — Static assets (images in `static/img/`, PDFs, manifest)
- `public/` — Build output (generated by running `hugo`)

## Blog Post Format

Posts live in `content/blog/<slug>.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title Here"
date: 2026-02-07T10:00:00-06:00
draft: true
slug: "post-slug"
categories: ['category1']
tags: ['tag1', 'tag2']
---

Markdown content here.
```

- **Filename**: kebab-case, e.g. `my-new-post.md`
- **Date**: ISO 8601 with timezone offset (author is in US Central, -06:00 CST / -05:00 CDT)
- **Permalink pattern**: `/:year/:month/:day/:slug` (defined in config.toml)
- **Emoji**: Enabled site-wide (`:sunglasses:` etc.)

## Creating a New Post

```bash
hugo new content/blog/my-post-slug.md
```

This scaffolds from `archetypes/default.md`. Then edit the generated file to set `title`, `categories`, `tags`, and write content. Set `draft: false` when ready to publish.

## Building & Previewing

```bash
hugo server -D    # Local dev server (includes drafts)
hugo server       # Local dev server (published posts only)
hugo              # Build static site into public/
```

## Current State Notes

- Only 1 post is published (`first.md`). The other 10 posts are `draft: true`.
- The `projects` menu item is commented out in `config.toml`.
- No CI/CD or deploy scripts currently exist in the repo.
- Google Analytics is configured with a UA- (Universal Analytics) ID which has been sunset.
