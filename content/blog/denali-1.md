# Motivation

Since I was young, I've been fascinated with the mountains.
This wasn't because I woke up, rolled over and saw the mountains outside my window.
No, it was precisely the lack of mountains in my life.

I guess, even more precisely, it was due to my infrequent access to the mountains followed by long stretches of flat, level land for as far as you could see.
That's Sakhalin first.
That's Houston second.
