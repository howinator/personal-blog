I'm not a particularly patriotic person, but seeing the USNS Comfort sail into New York Harbor and dock at Pier 90 swelled with me nationalistic pride.
Seeing the military arrive to assist the nation's largest city isn't something you witness many times in your lifetime.

In particular [this video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1097964027228407) is just an awe-inspiring site.
Just look at that shit.
Every other time I've seen one of the Navy's hospital shipts deployed, it's been to a third-world country.
And then I see this video of that same ship coming to assist our largest company?
It really drives home the severity of the situation.
