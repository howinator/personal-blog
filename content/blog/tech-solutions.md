According to [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/therapeutic), the word 'therapeutic' comes from the greek word therapeutá¸—s, which is someone who "waits on another, an attendant".
As a software engineer, there's not a whole lot I can do to affect the treatment of disease, a later meaning of the greek word.
However, I can help help people wait on and attend to one another.

I started a project with a friend yesterday to connect people that need help and people that can provide help.
Stay tuned for more.
