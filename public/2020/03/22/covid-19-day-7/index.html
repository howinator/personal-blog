    <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has to be the largest shared experience among humanity that we&rsquo;re all experiencing separately.
I can&rsquo;t think of another episode in modern history where nearly every human experienced in their own way.
And there really can&rsquo;t be another event where we experienced completely separate from one another.</p>
<p>Think about something like 9/11.
Only a few of us truly had to take some sort of action during 9/11.
Some of us had to run away.
Some of us gave blood.
But not all of us had to take action to avoid greater calamity.</p>
<p>This is what makes the Covid-19 pandemic so different.
All of us are actively participating in an event, creating our own experiences, but we&rsquo;re all doing it alone.
We&rsquo;re all sharing in the same experience, but it&rsquo;s different for all of us.
Some of us will be proud of our actions.
Some shameful.
But we&rsquo;ve all created our own story during this pandemic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting how this shared, but private, experience plays out once this is all said and done.</p>
