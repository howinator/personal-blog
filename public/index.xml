      <title>Mirace of Building</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the first time you fell in love with computers? That moment is one of my fondest memories. I was 13 and had just gotten back from watching Star Wars Episode III for the second time with my best friend, Andy. Andy and I were sitting at my parent’s Compaq doing what we had taken a great fondness to doing recently — editing wiki pages on Wookiepedia to replace instances of “C3PO” to “C3P****O” (I’ll let you fill in the blanks). Like the 7 times before, we saw the familiar page informing us we had been banned, except this time it was permanent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I was young, I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated with the mountains.&#xA;This wasn&amp;rsquo;t because I woke up, rolled over and saw the mountains outside my window.&#xA;No, it was precisely the lack of mountains in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess, even more precisely, it was due to my infrequent access to the mountains followed by long stretches of flat, level land for as far as you could see.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s Sakhalin first.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s Houston second.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>We Need GPL for the Climate</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently did a quick calculation to determine how much CO₂e would be emitted if I shipped a change which increased the size of a code artifact which we serve to our customers.&#xA;Based off &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2012/data/papers/0193-000409.pdf&#34;&gt;this article from the ACEEE&lt;/a&gt;, I found that a 1kb change to this artifact would result in ~6 metric tons of CO₂e being emitted yearly into the atmosphere.&#xA;This was surprising to me.&#xA;I work on software - the tech industry doesn&amp;rsquo;t cause climate change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 16 - Making Sense</title>
      <link>https://howinator.io/2020/04/02/covid-day-16/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Something else I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about this quarantine is how little sense I&amp;rsquo;d be able to make of it all.&#xA;On a daily basis, I oscillate between feeling like it&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world and everything is normal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like, within a one hour span, I&amp;rsquo;m refinancing my mortgage and reading an article about the coast guard telling cruise ships to turn away from American ports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 14 - USNS Comfort</title>
      <link>https://howinator.io/2020/03/30/covid-day-14/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a particularly patriotic person, but seeing the USNS Comfort sail into New York Harbor and dock at Pier 90 swelled with me nationalistic pride.&#xA;Seeing the military arrive to assist the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest city isn&amp;rsquo;t something you witness many times in your lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1097964027228407&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; is just an awe-inspiring site.&#xA;Just look at that shit.&#xA;Every other time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen one of the Navy&amp;rsquo;s hospital shipts deployed, it&amp;rsquo;s been to a third-world country.&#xA;And then I see this video of that same ship coming to assist our largest company?&#xA;It really drives home the severity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 13 - Lay It Down</title>
      <link>https://howinator.io/2020/03/28/covid-day-13/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once all this is done, we&amp;rsquo;re all going to lay it down and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I watched an ALC (the TV show) taping today and got pretty emotional seeing everyone in Austin having so much fun.&#xA;I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see my city return to that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 12 - Boredom</title>
      <link>https://howinator.io/2020/03/27/covid-day-12/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The thing they don&amp;rsquo;t tell you about quarantine is how freaking grating the boredom is.&#xA;Or, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know if it&amp;rsquo;s boredom, it&amp;rsquo;s just the absence of anything to be excited about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, why aren&amp;rsquo;t auto-scaling groups controlled with a PID?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 11 - Optimized Oven</title>
      <link>https://howinator.io/2020/03/26/covid-day-11/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re an oven manufacturer facing shareholder pressure.&#xA;Your goal is to make an oven that works for most customers as cheaply as possible.&#xA;You realize most of your American customers live in houses that are temperature-controlled to 75 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you start optimizing your oven to work in a 75 degree Fahrenheit environment.&#xA;You rip out insulation.&#xA;You install a temperature control system which works in a narrow range.&#xA;You adjust the natural gas valve so that, instead of being durable enough to switch on and off repeatedly, it delivers a constant stream of gas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 10 - Tech Therapeutics</title>
      <link>https://howinator.io/2020/03/25/covid-day-10/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/therapeutic&#34;&gt;wiktionary&lt;/a&gt;, the word &amp;rsquo;therapeutic&amp;rsquo; comes from the greek word therapeutḗs, which is someone who &amp;ldquo;waits on another, an attendant&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;As a software engineer, there&amp;rsquo;s not a whole lot I can do to affect the treatment of disease, a later meaning of the greek word.&#xA;However, I can help help people wait on and attend to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started a project with a friend yesterday to connect people that need help and people that can provide help.&#xA;Stay tuned for more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 7 - Shared Experience</title>
      <link>https://howinator.io/2020/03/22/covid-19-day-7/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 pandemic has to be the largest shared experience among humanity that we&amp;rsquo;re all experiencing separately.&#xA;I can&amp;rsquo;t think of another episode in modern history where nearly every human experienced in their own way.&#xA;And there really can&amp;rsquo;t be another event where we experienced completely separate from one another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think about something like 9/11.&#xA;Only a few of us truly had to take some sort of action during 9/11.&#xA;Some of us had to run away.&#xA;Some of us gave blood.&#xA;But not all of us had to take action to avoid greater calamity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Personal Kubernetes Cluster on Digital Ocean With kubeadm</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to bootstrapping a k8s cluster myself.&#xA;I really had two motivations for doing this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I wanted a k8s cluster that I could easily deploy new personal projects to.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I wanted a k8s cluster to hack on so I could further my understanding of k8s.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am now at at a point where I have a cluster which enables those motivations, so I decided it&amp;rsquo;s time to write a blog post about it (served from the k8s-cluster itself &amp;#x1f60e;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
