      <description>The Covid-19 pandemic has to be the largest shared experience among humanity that we&amp;rsquo;re all experiencing separately. I can&amp;rsquo;t think of another episode in modern history where nearly every human experienced in their own way. And there really can&amp;rsquo;t be another event where we experienced completely separate from one another.
Think about something like 9/11. Only a few of us truly had to take some sort of action during 9/11. Some of us had to run away.</description>
