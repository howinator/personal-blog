      <description>Introduction I finally got around to bootstrapping a k8s cluster myself. I really had two motivations for doing this:
 I wanted a k8s cluster that I could easily deploy new personal projects to. I wanted a k8s cluster to hack on so I could further my understanding of k8s.  I am now at at a point where I have a cluster which enables those motivations, so I decided it&amp;rsquo;s time to write a blog post about it (served from the k8s-cluster itself 🕶).</description>
